# Kernel Archive

Hand-written assembly versions of kernel files that have since been
rewritten in C, kept here for reference and size tracking.

This is the kernel-side analogue of [`archive/README.md`](../README.md),
which tracks user-space programs.  The split is intentional: kernel
files don't assemble standalone (they `%include` each other and reach
into shared globals), so the measurement mechanism differs from the
per-program builds the user-space archive uses.

## Binary Size Comparison

Each row records the assembled byte size of one kernel file, measured
two ways:

- **ASM (bytes)**: `os.bin` size when this one file is swapped to its
  archived hand-written form (everything else stays in C).
- **C (bytes)**: `os.bin` size when the entire kernel is in its
  current C form.  Same value across rows because the C-side build
  is the snapshot we publish.
- **Delta**: `C − ASM`.  Positive deltas are where cc.py emits more
  bytes than the hand-written original — those are the candidates
  for compiler optimization work.

Refresh with `tools/measure_kernel_ports.sh`, which runs the full
swap-and-rebuild loop and prints rows in this format directly.

The path key (left column) matches the file's location under `src/`,
minus the `.asm` extension (e.g. `drivers/ps2` is `src/drivers/ps2.asm`
archived as `archive/kernel/drivers/ps2.asm`, ported to
`src/drivers/ps2.c`).

| File | ASM (bytes) | C (bytes) | Delta |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------|

(no rows yet — first port lands the first row)

## Annotations

Per-file notes explaining each delta land in this section as ports
arrive.  The pattern: open with the file path + signed delta, follow
with the structural reason cc.py's output differs from the
hand-written asm.  Useful for spotting cc.py optimization
opportunities — e.g. "spilling X to a stack slot the asm kept in BX",
"materializing a `&array[i]` address that constant-folded in asm",
etc.
